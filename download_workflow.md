# Easiest Way to Download the Workflow

Since the file is too large to copy/paste easily, here are the best options:

## Option 1: Create a GitHub Gist (EASIEST)
1. I'll create the workflow content in smaller chunks
2. You copy each chunk into a text file
3. Save as `ai_horizon_complete_workflow.json`

## Option 2: Use a File Sharing Service
1. Upload the base64 text to a service like Pastebin
2. Decode it using an online decoder
3. Download the result

## Option 3: Direct Terminal Method
If you have access to a terminal with curl:
```bash
# Create a file with the base64 content
echo "BASE64_STRING_HERE" > workflow.b64

# Decode it
base64 -d workflow.b64 > ai_horizon_complete_workflow.json
```
