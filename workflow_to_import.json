# How to Get Your Workflow File

The workflow file `ai_horizon_complete_workflow.json` is already created but it's too large to display in the terminal.

## Option 1: Use Pastebin (EASIEST)
1. I'll create a Pastebin link for you
2. Go to the link
3. Copy all the content
4. Save as `ai_horizon_complete_workflow.json`

## Option 2: Use GitHub Gist
1. Go to https://gist.github.com
2. Create a new gist
3. I'll give you the content in parts

## Option 3: Direct File Transfer
Since the file is on the server, you need to download it to your computer.

The file contains:
- 19 nodes for complete RAG functionality
- Telegram bot integration
- Document processing with Dumpling AI
- Vector search with Supabase
- AI classification with GPT-4o-mini
- Chat memory and history
- Proper node connections

File size: 32,973 bytes (about 33KB)

Would you like me to:
1. Create a Pastebin link?
2. Show you how to use curl/wget to download it?
3. Create a simpler version of the workflow?
