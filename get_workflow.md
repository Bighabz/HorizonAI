# Simple Way to Get Your Workflow

The workflow has been split into 7 parts (each about 5KB).

## Steps:
1. Create a new file called `ai_horizon_complete_workflow.json` on your computer
2. Copy each part below IN ORDER and paste them into the file
3. Make sure there are NO line breaks between parts
4. Save the file

## Alternative: Use this command if you have Git Bash or Linux:
```bash
cat workflow_part_* > ai_horizon_complete_workflow.json
```

## The parts are:
- workflow_part_aa (5KB)
- workflow_part_ab (5KB)
- workflow_part_ac (5KB)
- workflow_part_ad (5KB)
- workflow_part_ae (5KB)
- workflow_part_af (5KB)
- workflow_part_ag (3KB)

Total: ~33KB

I'll show you each part one by one. Just say "show part 1" to start.
